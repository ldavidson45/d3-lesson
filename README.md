# Learning D3.js

D3.js is an opensource JavaScript library for creating data visualizations.

We have access to ridiculous amounts of data today, but massive repositories of data aren't really user-friendly. Data visualizations make this data easy to read and understand for the average person. D3.js allows web developers to implement highly custom and interactive data visualizations.

WHile there are many data visualization tools out there, D3 is a great choice for design-savvy people who want to set the look and feel of a visualization from scratch. It is also a great interactive tool because you can bind data values to objects, allowing for easy transformation of data, such as sorting or displaying additional information on a click.
